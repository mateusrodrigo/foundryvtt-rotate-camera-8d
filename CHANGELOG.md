## v1.0.1

- Fixed an issue where token vision/shadows could appear “stuck” or rotated incorrectly when using Rotate Camera 8D without Follow The Token.
- Rotation now nudges the camera center internally to force Foundry to refresh perception/vision, while keeping movement remap and rotation behavior unchanged.
